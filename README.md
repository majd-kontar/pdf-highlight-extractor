name of the pdf where they were highlighted as a header.

## Getting Started

## Usage

<br/>Enter the path to the folder containing the pdfs you have highlighted (make sure that all the pdfs are in the same
folder). 
<br/>Enter the output file name (the name of the docx file to be generated)
<br/>example: `output`
will save the output docx file in the directory of the pdfs as `output.docx`
